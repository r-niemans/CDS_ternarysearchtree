# CDS_tenarysearchtree

## Project Description :
The project aims at implementing a ternary search tree using Python.
The goal is to explore different ternary search trees and explore their efficiencies in handling searches and insertions. The goal is also to test their performance with small and large dataset on an HPC infrastuctures.
